        {% translate "Korila comes from the word korilus (Wildcrafting), and for both of us it means an important part of our roots - getting food and useables from nature. It was one of the most important ways of life in the lives of our ancestors and it continues to be strong in Estonians' chests to this day." %}<br>

        {% translate "If you have any ideas for developing the website, or if you happen to have a book on foraging gathering dust on your bookshelf that could be of use to us, please feel free to write. You can find our contact details here." %}<br>
